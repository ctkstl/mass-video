Christ the King - St. Louis -- Live Mass Streaming
==================================================

With the restrictions in place to combat the spread of COVID-19, we have turned to live streaming our masses so that 
our parishioners can still participate in weekly mass.

These masses can be viewed from our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmLbC-ty8n783Gfcq7Wh50g/).

Streaming Instructions
----------------------

1.  Hook up computer via (long) ethernet cable from Dawn's office
2.  Login to computer. Username "mass" password: (**see email**)
3.  Hook audio cable from the "Aux Out" port on the sound system to the microphone port on the computer (via redundant 
    Y-converters and RCA -> Headphone cable). When asked what type of input this is, select "mic".
4.  Hook webcam to any USB port on the computer
5.  Open OBS software. 
6.  You should be in "Studio Mode" (there is a button in the bottom right to switch to this if not) where you see two 
    output windows one called "Preview" and one called "Program". The program window is what will be captured into the 
    stream, the preview one is the one you can switch to immediately by clicking the "Transition" button in the middle. 
7.  In the bottom left are the "Scenes", there are three important ones: Pre-Roll (a message that we're online and 
    waiting for mass to start, no audio), Scene (or maybe I renamed it to something better?) that has the webcam and 
    microphone recording, and Post-Roll (a message to leave up for a couple minutes after the mass is over, no audio).
8.  To start off, select the Pre-roll, so that it is in the "Preview" window, then click "transition" to get it into 
    the "Program" window. Then select the recording scene, so it is in the preview window. 
9.  Verify that the camera captures the altar table, is level and centered
10. Open the firefox web browser and login to the youtube studio (should be a bookmark in the bar for it, or studio.
    youtube.com). It should already be logged in, but the username is ctkstlcalendars and the password is 
    (**see email**), if you need it.
11. Verify that you are in the "Christ the King - STL" channel, not the ctskstlcalendars channel. If not, select the 
    account icon in the upper-right corner and "Switch account" to that.
12. Click the "Go Live" button in the upper-right corner of the studio dashboard
13. It should give you the option to make a new stream with a "Copy and Create" button, click that.
14. Change the title to be something specific for the day's mass e.g. `Mass - March 22, 2020`. Once you click save, the 
    web page should be waiting for a connection from OBS.
15. In OBS click the "Start Streaming" button in the bottom left. In the youtube studio page, you should see the video 
    coming through with the text from OBS's program panel. This isn't going out to the youtube audience yet.
16. At 8:45 click the "Go Live" (or something to that effect) button in the upper right part of the youtube studio page. 
    This will cause the channel to start broadcasting the live stream. Check from another device that this is working.
17. When mass is ready to start, click the "Transition" button in OBS to make the live scene be the program. For backup 
    purposes, also click the "Start Recording" button in OBS. At your leisure, select the "Post-Roll" scene as the 
    "Preview".
18. When mass is finished, click the transition button to show the post-roll screen for a couple minutes. Then click the 
    "Stop Streaming" button. This should also stop the youtube stream. Also click "Stop Recording".
